# Plastic

_[A simple syntax and UI theme for Visual Studio Code.](https://will-stone.github.io/plastic/)_

---

v3 introduces a new syntax colour: lavender for functions. This helps tone-down
the amount of whiskey colour, which is now mainly used for JSX props. The scopes
have also been simplified further, separating them into clear types. However,
worry not if you preferred v2, this can still be found in the theme-picker under
"Plastic Legacy v2".

**PLEASE BE AWARE** this theme does **not** currently support Semantic Highlighting and it is suggested you disable Semantic Highlighting in VSCode's settings.

## Notable features

- Dark UI elements for all-day coding.
- Small colour palette to avoid visual overload.
- Additional deprioritised-punctuation theme; concentrate on the content.

## Colours

Inspired by Atom's One Dark theme, yet simpler and darker.

## Contribute

Themes can always be improved and tweaked so please feel free to log issues and
send pull requests. However, please keep in mind that this theme strives to
remain simple and language agnostic; for example, please do not ask for
`blah.blah.php` or `blah.blah.c` scopes to be added. Also, and this is purely
personal, I'm a JavaScript developer and therefore anything that alters the
colours for the JavaScript language will receive much more scrutiny before being
merged in.

Clone the repository to `.vscode/extenstions/`(remember to remove any other
installed versions of Plastic), run `yarn` to install dependencies, and
`yarn docs` to serve the documentation page.

Use Microsoft's
[theme color reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference)
for UI theming help.

You'll notice that the syntax is grouped by colour instead of scope. I find this
much nicer to maintain.

Happy hacking :)
