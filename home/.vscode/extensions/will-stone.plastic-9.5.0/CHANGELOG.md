# Change Log

All notable changes to the _Plastic_ theme will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [9.5.0] - 2024-03-31

- Theme the linked tag background. Previously this was the built-in orangey-red,
  it now uses Bunker.

## [9.4.2] - 2023-09-26

- Fix screenshot not found.

## [9.4.1] - 2023-09-26

- Update website URL to plastic.wstone.uk

## [9.4.0] - 2023-04-08

- Added support for diff/patch files.

## [9.3.1] - 2023-02-03

- Update changelogs.

## [9.3.0] - 2023-02-03

- Support bracket pair colorization.
- Add support for more statusbar items.

## [9.2.0] - 2023-01-08

- Add support for sticky scroll.

## [9.1.0] - 2023-01-08

- Git diffs are now brighter and more transparent which means the syntax should
  be easier to read through them, especially comments.

On a side-note, my "plus" experiment didn't work. My plan was to take the
in-built VSCode Dark+ theme and simply swap the colours with Plastic colours.
This would take all syntax maintenance away from Plastic. However, that theme
makes some colour combination choices that I'm not comfortable with. I'm still
looking into a more semantic-compatible Plastic theme, but not sure on the
approach yet.

## [9.0.0] - 2023-01-04

Reverting the Persian Pink change from 8.0.0. It seems it didn't play nicely
with a few languages. I'm going to leave Plastic main theme as is for now. I
have another idea to solve the problem I was having with Svelte components'
colour. Not sure if it's going to work but for now let's call it _Plastic+_ (no,
it's not a subscription service! üòÜ). _Plastic+_ will be an additional theme,
along with the main and _deprioritised punctuation_ themes.

## [8.0.0] - 2022-12-27

The first major change to Plastic in over a year and a half, and‚Ä¶ ü•Å ‚Ä¶we have a
new colour! Please welcome [Persian Pink](https://plastictheme.com/palette) to
the party ü•≥

I've recently started using Svelte and the component tags were the same colour
as the html elements, making them quite hard to see. I tried updating them to
blue, as per the 7.6.0 release below. However, as Svelte component tags are
classified as class names, this meant I
[inadvertently made class names the same colour as the "class" storage keyword](https://github.com/will-stone/plastic/issues/186).

After some experimentation, I found that it was best to split class names
(including component tag names) and storage key words (`class`, `const`, `let`
etc.), which meant a new colour was required, and Persian Pink is now the colour
of class names and component tags.

## [7.6.1] - 2022-12-27

- Rollback below change as the class storage and class names were now same
  colour.

## [7.6.0] - 2022-12-24

- Svelte components blue, same as React components.

## [7.5.0] - 2021-09-03

- Use transparent inlay hint background. I've found having the hints display the
  same as comments (as this is, in essence, all they are) makes them less
  distracting.

## [7.4.1] - 2021-09-03

- Update changelog.

## [7.4.0] - 2021-09-03

- Add support for inlay hints.

## [7.3.0] - 2021-05-06

- Add toolbar hover background.

## [7.2.0] - 2021-04-29

- Remove unused activityBar.dropBackground.
- Add secondary button colour.
- Declare primary button hover colour.

## [7.1.0] - 2021-04-28

- Add support for ReScript component tags.

## [7.0.1] - 2021-04-23

- Fix changelog.

## [7.0.0] - 2021-04-23

- If you were you using the _Plastic Legacy v2_ theme, this has now been removed
  from the main Plastic project and kindly adopted by Hadi Alqattan:
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HadiAlqattan.plastic-legacy

## [6.0.0] - 2021-04-10

If you were you using the _Plastic Legacy v2_ theme, this has now been
officially deprecated. The theme is still available, under the name _DEPRECATED
Plastic Legacy v2_, but will be removed in the next major release. If you are
using this, I urge you to volunteer to be its maintainer. See here for more
details: https://github.com/will-stone/plastic/issues/168

  sidebar item.

  styled.

## [3.0.0] - 2020-02-09

v3 introduces a new syntax colour: lavender for functions. This helps tone-down
the amount of whiskey colour, which is now mainly used for JSX props. The scopes
have also been simplified further, separating them into clear types. However,
worry not if you preferred v2, this can still be found in the theme-picker under
"Plastic Legacy v2".

- Simplified config and build script.

- Feat: Darker inactive activity bar icons. Closes [#29](https://github.com/will-stone/plastic/issues/29).
- Fix: low contrast text on git warning. Closes [#25](https://github.com/will-stone/plastic/issues/25).

## [2.1.0] - 2018-06-10

Updates to the upcoming builder/compiler mean slight tweaks to the theme.

- JS terminator (semi-colons) are same as all other punctuation (use the
  deprioritised theme if you need these to be more subtle). This may change back
  in the future, depending on public opinion.
- Inactive tab text is darker.
- List active highlight swapped with list hover: active is now the lighter
  colour.

## [2.0.2] - 2018-06-03

- Looks like the move worked. Forgot the README though, this update adds it
  back.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-06-03

- This is a test to see if I can move the Plastic theme into a sub-directory. If
  it breaks the theme, I'll roll it back.

## [2.0.0] - 2018-05-30

- New v2 config system allows you to make your own variation of Plastic. More
  info soon.
- Even less specific scopes means Plastic really is a _simple theme_.
- Various workbench tweaks to standardise some colours.

v2 has been in the making for quite some time. Please report any issues on
GitHub.

## [1.11.2] - 2018-05-29

- v2's compiler ready.
- Deprioritised v2 theme.

## [1.11.1] - 2018-05-22

v2 beta: use v1 syntax colours (mainly).

## [1.11.0] - 2018-05-21

- I have been testing a new version for some time and am nearly ready to release
  Plastic v2!
  - Most colours have been tweaked to match their name on
    [Chirag's website](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/). e.g. Whiskey
    is now a solid whiskey colour instead of an approximation. This gives a more
    vibrant feel and better contrast.
  - Added an easier method to configure the theme. Now there's three config
    files: the colour names, syntax, and workbench configurations. A build
    script runs through these and outputs the resulting theme file in the themes
    folder. Clone the repo and try it yourself using `yarn build`.
  - The scope (syntax) have been simplified further, using (even more!) generic
    rules. I've tried to keep the scopes to two levels of specification, with a
    maximum of three if necessary.

Note: v2 will soon become the next version of Plastic so please provide
feedback. v1 will no longer be maintained and will eventually be removed. This
is due to the new way that the theme is built and configured (see above). This
theme will also no longer provide a deprioritised-punctuation version. However,
after v2 has been finalised, I will start a _Plastic Forks_ program, and will
add in a Plastic-Deprioritised-Punctuation theme as its first entry. If you rely
on this variation, I suggest sticking with the legacy version for now (I won't
remove it until the new one is released).
