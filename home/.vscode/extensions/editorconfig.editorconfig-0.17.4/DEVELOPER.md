# Notes for Developers

## Publish

Before publishing, please make sure CHANGELOG.md is up-to-date, because this
will be displayed in the [changelog tab][] in the Marketplace. Please only add
changes directly relevant to users there, e.g., no changes about tests and CI.

To publish a newer version to the Market Place, follow the [VSCode official
instructions][]. Then,
[Open VSX should update automatically](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/open-vsx.org/wiki/Auto-Publishing-Extensions#how-to-auto-publish-an-extension).
