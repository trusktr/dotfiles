## [1.1.85]
- [`Themes`] Reintroduced `Midnight` sub-theme on certain combination of colors for all my skins;
- [`Development`] Added code based on array `excluded_combo` that can exclude some combinations of color variants in sub-theme for unsightliness or similarity to other skin due to filtering: basically i've excluded some skins based on cold colors from `Low Blue` sub-theme and some skins based on warm colors from `Midnight` sub-theme.
