## High-Contrast (Dark) – WCAG 2.0 AA compliant

The theme colours offered in the high-contrast theme have been run through [the Web Accessibility in Mind Contrast Checker tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify colour contrast requirements for small text as per the WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines.

This theme is built off of the legacy dark theme and therefore does not offer the additional JSON and Markdown support.

Thanks to [poteto](https://github.com/poteto) for highlighting this oversight and collaborating on the high-contrast mod. 🚀

I've verified the colour combinations using the tool above but if I've missed anything and you've found any contrast issues, please [comment on this issue](https://github.com/tinacious/vscode-tinacious-design-syntax/issues/12) so I can re-open it or create a new one.
