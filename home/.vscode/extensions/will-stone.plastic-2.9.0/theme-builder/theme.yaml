# Your theme's name must begin with Plastic, e.g. Plastic Horses
name: Plastic

# Your theme must provide hex values for these 6 normal and 6 bright colours.
# The terminal colours they are associated with is shown next to them. The
# colour you set does not necessarily need to match the terminal name, they are
# your available palette for your syntax colours. Do not add, remove, or rename
# the palette names. I highly recommend the Color Highlight plugin that will
# make it easier to see which colours your palette is using.
