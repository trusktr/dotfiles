# ex-mode-sort package

Adds the `:sort` command to [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode)

# Use

Install both [vim-mode](https://atom.io/packages/vim-mode) and [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode). Type `:` in command mode. Enter `sort`.

By default, as in vim, sort is case sensitive. For a case insensitive sort, pass the `i` flag: `:sort i`.
