# atom-browser-webview package

A web browser that runs seamlessly in the Atom editor

## Info / Features

This is a web browser tightly integrated into the Atom editor.  The web pages appear in the normal editor tabs.  The pages are fully functional with scripting and linking. A browser toolbar appears at the top of the Atom window to allow simple webpage navigation.

* Is an actual web browser, no use of iframes so every site should load as it would in Chrome or Firefox. (Some individual web features i.e. popups may not be supported) *

### News (Dec. 3rd 2015)

Updated to work with Atom 1.0, probably once again the only working web browser.

---

Finally a working tabbed browser, using webviews. (No iframes) The easiest way to get going is to toggle the UI in Browser -> Show / Hide Browser UI, or make atom.workspace.open('http://google.com/'); calls after launching.

This extension is designed to support multiple active tabs using visibility: css to work-around the deallocating webviews with display: none;
