  "readme": "# atom-domterm\nan Atom package for the DomTerm terminal emulator\n\n![screenshot](screenshot1.png)\n\nDomTerm is a terminal emulator/multiplexer with lots of\nnice features. Most notably you can embed graphics/html,\nand session management is included.\nSee http://domterm.org for more about DomTerm.\n\nThe atom-domterm package requires the ``domterm`` command to be\nin your PATH.  (If not, edit the ``domtermCommand`` variable\nin ``lib/domterm-view.js``.)  The domterm command runs as a server,\nwhich provides session (pty) management, and serves up the needed\nJavaScript and styles.  Apart from the domterm application,\natom-domterm requires no native code or extra packages.\n\nTo run atom-domterm, place a link to the atom-domterm directory\nin ``~/.atom/packages``.  Then DomTerm should come up in\nthe Atom ``Packages`` menu.\n\nNote there is already an Electron wrapper for DomTerm, which\nworks very well.  That is included in the DomTerm sources,\nand is the default user interface for DomTerm.\n\nThe atom-domterm package has only been tested on Fedora 27.\nMost functionality works pretty well, though more testing\nis needed.\n\n## Features\n\n* A solid modern terminal emulator.\n  Mouse handling; 24-bit color; encodes special keys.\n  Good xterm compatibility and does very well on the vttest test suite.\n  Good Unicode support, including wide characters.\n* Integrates well with the Atom pane system.\n  The screenshot show 3 sessions, named \"DomTerm:1\" (default name)\n  plus \"compile\" and \"run\" (in an inactive tab).\n  The \"window title\" of the active terminal is displayed both\n  in the message area and in the main title bar.\n* Error message from many compilers are turned into clickable links.\n  The `compile` pane of the screenshot show the effect of mouse hover\n  over the warning - note the corresponding file URL in the message area.\n  Clicking on the link is customizable - the default opens an atom\n  editor tab positioned at the corresponding line.\n* You can \"print\" graphics or general HTML.\n  This makes domterm suitable as a \"graphing calculator\".\n  The screenshot show an image \"printed\" by the `domterm imgcat` command.\n  Gnuplot can [display graph output inline](http://per.bothner.com/blog/2016/gnuplot-in-domterm/).\n  You can have the `man` command print HTML to the console.\n  Many other possibilities.\n* You can style the terminal using CSS.  This is usually done in\n  `~/.domterm/settings.ini`, which is automatically reloaded when saved.\n  The screenshot shows how you can set terminal-specific background colors.\n* Remembers tab characters and distingishes explict new-line from line-wrap.\n  So you can `cat` a `Makefile`, and then copy-and-paste it.\n  Lines are re-wrapped on terminal re-size.\n* The basic \"session management\" functionality of `tmux` or GNU Screen:\n  You can detach and re-attach session.\n* Builtin optional line-editor (like a simplified `readline`).\n* Builtin optional pager (like a simplified `less`).\n",
